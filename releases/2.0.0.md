## Waffle Takeout 2.0.0
_Released 2015.12.09_

_Supported GH:E versions: GH:E 2.2+_

#### New Features
- The 2.0 release train is delivered via [Replicated](../doc/REPLICATED.md). If you're on a 1.x version or earlier that was self-installed with docker images, we'll support upgrading to 2.0 soon. Replicated currently requires an internet connection during installation and upgrades. Updates to the 1.x train will continue until the upgrade path from 1.x is supported, and until Replicated supports installation without an internet connection.

#### Bug Fixes
- Support reconfiguring takeout configuration without resetting database
  - When changing the GH:E url, oauth token & secret, or adding GitHub.com support after configuring the first time, Takeout wouldn't pick up on the change unless you reset your database (awesome). This is fixed.
